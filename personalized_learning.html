					When it comes to education and schooling, it is not uncommon to see students struggling when trying to grasp difficult concepts. In these cases, the blame is often put upon either the student for being lazy and unwilling to learn the material or the teacher for being incapable of teaching well enough for the students to be able to learn the concepts, with both outputs resulting in one of the parties being thought of as incapable of doing what they were supposed to do.
					<br><br>
					However, it has gotten to the point in society where it is a rarity to question whether we know the true cause to certain situations and will jump to the most reasonable conclusions in our minds. In the case of situations such as those stated previously, the likely cause of it could very well just be how students are taught through the educational system and how that may actually hinder their understanding of specific topics.
					<br><br>
					When going through classes, students are usually given a very short period of time to grasp difficult concepts, with the majority of the information being taught being topics that are new to the students. They are expected to be able to fully understand and master those concepts, well enough that their understanding gained within that time frame would allow for them to apply their knowledge in a test to evaluate how well they were able to comprehend it. However, it is very rare to find people who are capable of fully understanding complex concepts such as those learned in school within such a short time, leaving a large portion of students with gaps in their learning as a result of this structure. Putting this in terms of mathematics, each unit is designed to be able to build on what had been learned through the previous ones, so being able to understand derivates, for example, would require for exponents, graphing, variables, and other concepts to be common knowledge for students. When expecting students with gaps in their education learn how to calculate derivatives, however, results in a barrier in their learning as too many previous concepts had been essentially passed over as a result of school moving too fast for the learner. This leads to the common situation where a student would essentially feel incapable of solving derivatives, and at that point give up on going into any field where calculus would be a necessity.
					<br><br>
					The reason that these gaps occur is believed to be the result of the one-size-fits-all model that schools are based around.<a class = "cite" href = "https://www.ted.com/talks/sal_khan_let_s_teach_for_mastery_not_test_scores?language=en" target = "_blank">[10]</a> This model requires that every student goes at the same pace as everyone else and punish those incapable of keeping up by failing them. However, as everyone will almost always have their own learning styles and pace at which they move at, this model is incapable of accounting for individuality and assumes each student is the same learner.
					<br><br>
					As a way of avoiding the gaps appearing in students' knowledge, changing the one-size-fits-all model most schools are based around to a more individualized and learner-based system would be incredibly beneficial to the learner's education. In allowing students to go at their own pace in their learning and give them time to grasp complex concepts, it is very likely that the general interest and abilities of the younger generations would substantially increase as the stress, worry, and anxiety regarding learning through the traditional model would be replaced with curiousity and passion for it, considering that students going at their own pace would allow for them to be able to grasp concepts much easier.
					<br><br>
					One example of how this system could be implemented is the <i>flipped classroom</i>. As the name suggests, the flipped classroom model essentially reverses the traditional roles of how students and teachers go about their schooling, having students do their learning outside of school through online lectures, books, websites, etc., and complete assignments and work within school. This model has been seen to significantly improve how well students have been able to comprehend concepts and increase the engagement and interest within the classroom. Using this model, it allows for the students to be able to move at their own pace when it comes to understanding concepts within the comfort of their own homes, work with other students to try and make sense of concepts they may not understand, and have the teacher available when they need help.
					<br><br>
					An example of this flipped classroom in action would be the math department at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. Since the mid-1990s, the department had been teaching calculus under the flipped classroom model. As stated by Dan Berrett, a senior editor for The Chronical of Higher Education,
					<div class = "quotation">
						“Consistent with the flipping model, students at Michigan do their reading before class. The instructor gives a brief lecture, asks them about the reading, and goes through an example from the textbook. Students take turns going to the board to present their answers or working in groups, which might be followed by another short lecture.” <a class = "cite" href = "http://commons.marymount.edu/instructingonline/wp-content/uploads/sites/135/2013/07/Flipping-The-Chronicle.pdf">[11]</a>
					</div>
					To test the effectiveness of this model, students attending the University of Michigan had taken concept inventories before and after going through calculus in which their final score was calculuated based on the maximum gain from the course. Comparing the scores to that from other departments under the traditional model of teaching, there was a gain of nearly twice as much, clearly showing the effectiveness of straying away from the traditional model.
					<br><br>
					There is no doubt that developing a successful school system capable of taking into account each individual's needs and interests is no easy task and should not be looked at as so. However, the traditional model of teaching has been shown to be ineffective when it comes to educating every individual student and providing an equal opportunity in life. Considering this, we shouldn't have to rely on a broken system to educate our youth, but try to find the best possible ways of providing the most reasonable and useful model that impacts every student positively, which means that looking at models such as the flipped classroom model and listening to the feedback of the students, parents, and teachers would be greatly beneficial to developing a system that satisfies every personality. It will without a doubt be no easy task to implement a system into an already-established education model, but no positive change in the world has ever been easy, and this change lies as one of the primary problems that could provide a much brighter future for the human species if fixed.
