				<div class = "text">
					Standardized testing has become the primary method of evaluating the progress and development of youth proceeding through the educational system, and despite the vast implementation of the system, it has amassed a fair amount of criticism as a result of the many flaws and controversies surrounding how well it is capable of testing the youth.
					<br><br>
					The purpose of standardized testing is to evaluate the knowledge of the youth, doing so by having them answer several questions which relate to topics required to be understood by students. However, this system has been shown to be an inaccurate portrayal of student’s current knowledge for many reasons, but a prominent one is that how well a student performs on a test is not only dependent on the student’s knowledge but other external variables as well. Two of the biggest influences in taking tests include personal conflicts, grade-spread requirement and situational/environmental factors.<a class = "cite" href = "https://www.uleth.ca/teachingcentre/standardized-testing-fair-or-not" target = "_blank">[3]</a>
					<br><br>
					Personal conflicts are more obvious factors that can affect students and can include anything from anxiety, nerves, mental illness, or any recent conflict that had negatively affected them could greatly skew the results of the test and misinform the teachers of the results. 
					<br><br>
					Situational and environmental factors can be less obvious but can also have an incredible impact on the result of the testing. Anything from poor lighting, extreme temperatures, or distracting smells could greatly reduce focus and make it difficult to retain and remember information needed for the test, which will as well result in skewed and inaccurate results. 
					<br><br>
					The last factor lies in how tests are typically structured. As the purpose of standardized testing is to evaluate the knowledge of a large group of students, the easiest way to structure it would be to have a single test handed out to everyone, having everyone answer the same questions in the same way. However, the issue with this is that every student is different and each one will have their own individual way of learning and relaying information. For most, memorization may not be their strong suit which would lead to difficulties in taking tests and poor test results and despite the fact they may be great at the topic being tested, the only thing looked at by teachers is the test which leads to an inaccurate portrayal of student’s abilities.
					<br><br>
					In addition to the external variables which impact the performance of students, it is not uncommon for people to express concern or severe stress and worry regarding tests. According to Statistics Canada, approximately 7% of all people aged 15 - 24 years old are at risk of depression disorders <a class = "cite" href = "https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/pub/82-003-x/2017001/article/14697-eng.htm" target = "_blank">[4]</a> and approximately 12% of Canadians had reported having test anxiety. <a class = "cite" href = "https://vanierinstitute.ca/perspectives-test-anxiety-student-lens/" target = "_blank">[5]</a> Considering these statistics and the severe worry and stress people may feel in regards to how they would perform in tests, it is very likely the stress of schooling and education could result in the deterioration of student's mental health and possibly heighten the issues regarding mental illness, resulting in a ruthless system that is incapable of taking into account student's mental well being and does what it wants at the expense of the youth.
