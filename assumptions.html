					School systems are designed to be universally applicable to all students within the educational system, and understandably so considering the large variety of personalities and characteristics each student will possess and trying to favour each one would be a difficult task to make a reality. However, trying to implement a universal system results in it greatly relying on assumptions of most things regarding the students, and trying to apply assumptions to a variety of personalities, learning styles, interests, etc. leads to a system incapable of taking into account the student.
					<br><br>
					One of the primary issues regarding assuming the capabilities and personalities of students lies in the structure of the curriculum. Most often, a large portion of what is learned in school is mandatory and covers a variety of topics - including science, math, history, and others. However, this requires students to be able to comprehend complex topics within a very short amount of time and runs under the assumption they are capable of grasping those concepts by having the drive, interest, and motivation to be able to fully understand it. As a result of this, students may often experience a large amount of stress and worry from being unable to keep up with the vision of the government and are typically faced with repercussions if incapable of performing well enough.
					<br><br>
					An additional negative effect of relying on assumptions lies in an unreasonable expectation of performance (aside from what has already been mentioned). Schools often run five days a week for 7 hours each, taking up a large portion of student's days. Throughout the length of the school days, students are expected to complete work and pay attention to the best of their abilities, which although can be a reasonable expectation will often assume students are always in their peak state and are at all times capable of completing ample work, which is where it gets unreasonable. Many factors can affect the performance of students, including mental illness, conflicts, disinterest, or just not being in the right mindset and readiness to learn everyday, so to expect students to be able to actively participate and be fully engaged in discussions is, quite frankly, ridiculous.
