					Every problem we face has a solution, and education is no exception. If taken into effect, there are many solutions to modern education that can greatly improve how students learn through schooling and be able to provide a brighter and better future for them.
					<br><br>
					<b>Less Emphasis on Marks</b>
					<br>
					Within schooling and education, marks have been the primary indicator as to the progress of a student throughout their studies. However, as had been stated <a class = "link" href = "marks.html">here</a>, marks can often be ineffective in the improvement of a student's understanding of concepts and could, if done wrong, confuse them further and setting them back even more.

					<b>More Personalized Learning</b>
					<br>
					When it comes to education and schooling, it is not uncommon to see students struggling when trying to grasp difficult concepts. In these cases, the blame is often put upon either the student for being lazy and unwilling to learn the material or the teacher for being incapable of teaching well enough for the students to be able to learn the concepts, with both outputs resulting in one of the parties being thought of as incapable of doing what they were supposed to do.
