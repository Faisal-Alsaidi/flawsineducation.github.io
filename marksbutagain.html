				<div class = "title">Less Emphasis on Marks</div>
				<div class = "text">
					Within schooling and education, marks have been the primary indicator as to the progress of a student throughout their studies. However, as had been stated <a class = "link" href = "marks.html">here</a>, marks can often be ineffective in the improvement of a student's understanding of concepts and could, if done wrong, confuse them further and setting them back even more.
					<br><br>
					One of the potential fixes to how the modern system of marking works is to focus on different types of "marking". As had been stated by Caroline Elbra-Ramsay,
					<div class = "quotation">
						“Effective feedback needs to work as dialogue between learner and teacher, and students need to engage with the feedback. In Higher Education, the reality of the nature and timing of written feedback means that it can often act as an obstacle to this engagement rather than facilitate it.” <a class = "cite" href = "https://www.beds.ac.uk/jpd/volume-1-issue-2/can-quality-marking-be-used-to-provide-effective-feedback-within-higher-education" target = "_blank">[9]</a>
					</div>
					Following that idea, marking should be less heavily influenced by a number given to the student to show their progress, but rather be more interactive and feedback-oriented. This concept would follow a structure where the teacher would provide direct suggestions and information that would help the student know both where they need to work on and how they should work on it, giving them a clear understanding of what would need to be done to improve their knowledge and do well. In doing so, the overarching emphasis of education would greatly shift from avoiding the very idea of "failing" but rather to improve yourself as a learner and grow in fields where your interests and creativity could thrive, as the anxiety and stress from attempting to get a high grade would be lifted from the view of education and the only main objective when it comes to school would therefore be nothing more than learning.
					<br><br>
					To further improve the outcome of education and shift the focus away from marks, the concept of providing a final mark or percentage at the end of the school year could be given a major modification, as currently it comes with many flaws. These flaws include the competitive aspects that arise when it comes to achieving a number to prove your knowledge, the severe discouragement in the situation where you are given a poor mark, and the extreme consequences and stress which overshadow the fact that education should be the primary focus of schooling. Rather than having a single cumulative number independently acting as a representation of a student's progress in learning, the "final mark" should rather be something that showcases how the student is capable of utilizing their newly established knowledge in a real-world scenario, acting as a way to allow for students, parents, and teachers to be able to see the growth of student's education without the stress and worry of achieving a final mark. This, accompanied with a different form of marking, would allow for a system where the emphasis falls less on marks and percentages, but rather on learning and education, allowing school to be an excellent resource for learning.
