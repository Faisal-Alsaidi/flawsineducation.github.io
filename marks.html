					Education relies on the concept of making mistakes and learning how to avoid making the same mistakes in the future to grow in a specific area. To be able to achieve this, a certain level of feedback from more experienced persons makes the process incredibly easier and quicker to grasp concepts. In modern education, the primary form of receiving this feedback is through having teachers mark assignments and tests with the occasional note explaining what could have been done better, with the purpose of it being to have the learner understand what they had done wrong and learn from that.
					<br>
					However, as had been stated by Sean Harford, the National Director of Education for the Office in Standards in Education (Ofsted),
					<div class = "quotation">
						“There is remarkably little high-quality, relevant research evidence to suggest that detailed or extensive marking has any significant impact on pupils’ learning.” <a class = "cite" href = "https://chartered.college/research-effective-marking-feedback-mathematics" target = "_blank">[6]</a>
					</div>
					<br>
					One of the primary issues with the typical marking system is that the feedback generated from it is relatively incapable of informing the learner of their mistakes and how they could improve. Typically when being given back assignments or tests, any mistakes made by the student is corrected by or brought up by the teacher, with the main purpose of the correction being to inform the student about what they may need to work on. However, upon the assignment being marked and handed back, all mistakes made on it are permanently taken into account to the learner's overall mark, giving the impression their first few attempts at utilizing the information will reflect on their complete capabilities and knowledge. 
					<br><br>
					Additionally, the feedback provided will often consist of little information on how the learner would need to do to improve, but rather leaves them with <i>what</i> they would need to improve on. This type of feedback can be analogous to "disclosing tablets" used by dentists.<a class = "cite" href = "https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00405849609543699?journalCode=htip20" target = "_blank">[7]</a> Sometimes when children with poor dental hygiene go to the dentist to get their teeth cleaned, the dentist will give them a red tablet which, upon chewing it, will release a red dye which sticks to any problematic areas in their teeth that the child could work on. This concept of providing problematic areas could be seen as what the marking system is doing, with red dye being the red ink on the assignment or test informing the student of what they had gotten wrong. 
					<br><br>
					However, knowing what you need to work on is often not enough and may not aid in the learner's abilities to grow in that area. Studies have shown that a simple marking identifying what the student had done wrong was ineffective in helping them grow, and could confuse them in the condition the marking was unclear. <a class = "cite" href = "https://www.beds.ac.uk/jpd/volume-1-issue-2/can-quality-marking-be-used-to-provide-effective-feedback-within-higher-education" target = "_blank">[8]</a> What had been shown to be effective was providing markings that went into what the learner could do to avoid making that mistake in the future, as it would allow them to have a clear plan to their learning and their improvement in that subject area.
