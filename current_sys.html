					Within the book <i>Constructivist Teacher Education</i>, Jennifer A. Vadeboncoeur goes into how education systems generally revolve around two fundamental views in which she states, <div class = 'quotation'>“Throughout the twentieth century, two competing views of child development and the purpose of education have framed the teaching of pedagogy in teacher education. In the first view, the purpose of education is to educate the individual child in a manner which supports the child’s interests and needs…In the second view, the purpose of education is social transformation and the reconstruction of society aligned with democratic ideals.” <a class = 'cite' href = 'https://www.taylorfrancis.com/books/e/9780203973684/chapters/10.4324/9780203973684-9' target = '_blank'>[2]</a></div>These views are generally the basis most education systems rely on in modern schooling and shape the way youth are educated of the world.<br><br>Public schools are one of the more common forms of schooling in society, and most will follow the same general structure. Students are expected to be taught material on a specific topic, utilize that information within assignments as a method of practicing the material, and complete tests following several lessons regarding a large amount of material on the topic as to show the student’s participation during class and evaluate how well they were able to pertain and utilize the material.<br><br>The topics covered is provided by a curriculum developed by the provincial government and will typically cover material that relates to the modern world and how society is run using various important concepts. The intent of this is to educate the youth on information that will aid in their integration into society and help in understanding the intricacies of mechanisms of the world, allowing for a generation of people capable of utilizing discoveries to progress the human race in areas that would be beneficial to our growth as a species.
