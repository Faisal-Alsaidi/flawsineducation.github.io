					School is the fundament of society; it conceives a foundation of the knowledge youth would need to know regarding the modern world and aids in finding and developing interests. Considering the vast importance of knowledge and getting through life in the best way possible, it has become a norm to attend school or get an education, as anything otherwise would be looked down upon.<br><br>However, it is common for the general purpose and function of the modern education system to be overlooked and assumed is the best for the youth, which begs the question of whether the current system really works or not. Criticism is not uncommon for the method students learn through schooling, with a prime example being Albert Einstein’s famous quotation in which he stated, <div class = 'quotation'>“Education is what remains after one has forgotten what one has learned from school,” <a class = 'cite' href = 'https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ1076383.pdf' target = '_blank'>[1]</a></div> which nods to the fact that what is learned in school is often forgotten after a very short period of time.<br><br>Considering the controversy surrounding the modern education system, we should take a step back and consider how we are teaching our youth and what changes could be made to develop our understanding of the world while utilizing the best methods to do so, rather than just continuing with what we had been doing since the ancient Sumerians.
