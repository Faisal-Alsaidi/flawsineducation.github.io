					As had been stated, the modern educational system has several flaws which may hinder the ability for students to retain and understand topics covered throughout their years in school. Some of these common flaws include any of the following:
					<br><br>
					<b>Standardized Testing</b>
					<br>
					Standardized testing has become the primary method of evaluating the progress and development of youth proceeding through the educational system, and despite the vast implementation of the system, it has amassed a fair amount of criticism as a result of the many flaws and controversies surrounding how well it is capable of testing the youth. <a class = "read-more" href = "tests.html">Read More >>></a>
					<br><br>
					<b>Marking</b>
					<br>
					Education relies on the concept of making mistakes and learning how to avoid making the same mistakes in the future to grow in a specific area. To be able to achieve this, a certain level of feedback from more experienced persons makes the process incredibly easier and quicker to grasp concepts. In modern education, the primary form of receiving this feedback is through having teachers mark assignments and tests with the occasional note explaining what could have been done better, with the purpose of it being to have the learner understand what they had done wrong and learn from that.

					<br><br>
					<b>Assumptions</b>
					<br>
					School systems are designed to be universally applicable to all students within the educational system, and understandably so considering the large variety of personalities and characteristics each student will possess and trying to favour each one would be a difficult task to make a reality. However, trying to implement a universal system results in it greatly relying on assumptions of most things regarding the students, and trying to apply assumptions to a variety of personalities, learning styles, interests, etc. leads to a system incapable of taking into account the student.
